## How DeePMD- kit works

Here is where I will give a more comprehensive report on DeepMD-kit and specifically its potential usefulness to the lab- or researchers in general

## License and Credits
None of this kit and its code is mine, and you use this code you can use the citation below. The project DeePMD-kit is licensed under GNU LGPLv3.0.

# Installation

If some video tutorials are necessary to guide someone through the installation and use of DeePMD- kit I could put some here:

# Create instance of Linux to use DeePMD-kit 

DeePMD- kit is native to Linux, so you are required to run it there. If you already have an instance of Linux, skip this step. If you need to install Linux, I will provide a quick tutorial on what I found to be the best way to install and run Linux on a PC.

## Download using Conda

To install the DeePMD-kit, you must first install Anaconda or Miniconda. If storage space on your instance of Linux is an issue, use Miniconda. If you already have one of these, skip the next step. 

Install Anaconda here or Miniconda here. 

From here on I will only focus on the CPU version of this kit. If I find out that the GPU version may also be necessary, then I will include it. 

Open the terminal in Linux, and begin the installation. 
To install the CPU version via Conda: 

`conda install deepmd-kit=*=*cpu lammps-dp=*=*cpu -c deepmodeling`
